## Hello World! 
My name is Gabriele Rivi, I'm a recent graduate in the field of Data Science in a double degree program with EIT - EIT Digital Master School. I attended the first year at Politecnico di Milano in Italy, and the second one at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland!
I'm studying and working to learn the main techniques and tools used in the area of Machine and Deep Learning, as well as Data Science. 
In the scope of my studies, with a minor in I&E, I also got to learn the main tools and approaches used for strategic and marketing-level analysis, getting a grasp on how business units are created from the ground up, what's important to communicate and which steps are necessary to be made before boarding onto a new activity. In the scope of this minor I worked on different projects in collaboration with companies, in the role of external consultants for finding new value propositions or new market to entry. These projects were carried out both as university courses and during a summer school attended at TUM (Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen).
I grew interested in ML and DL techniques, mostly because of all the potential that these fields intrinsically have, with all the possible achievement that can be reached using these kind of technologies and models to uplift performances and results in any application.

I concluded my studies with a Master Thesis entitled "Software Defined Networking Energy Optimization through Traffic Prediction on Mobile Access Network", developed within the Software Defined Networking department at Ericsson Finland. During the development of this project I had the opportunity to develop a forecasting model to be production-ready and establish a functioning framework in the form a microservice-based application. For more information please refer to the Thesis document publicly [available here](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/124067)
